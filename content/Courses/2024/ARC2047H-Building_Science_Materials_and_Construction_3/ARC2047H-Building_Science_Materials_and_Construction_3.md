	- Sensible Heat (): H>s
	- Total Head (): H

For a well-sealed and highly insulated room with a wall air conditioner, how much **heat energy** would need to be removed from the room to get from a starting condition where the air is at 31 C and 56% RH to and a ending condition where the air is at 19 and 49% RH?  The room has a width of 10m, a length of 15m and is 3m high. Provide your answer in kJ as an integer.  Do not write the units in your answer.

h1=27.2kJ/kg
h2=65.5kJ/kg
V=450m^3
Dry air mass1 (kg) = Room volume (m^3) ÷ SV1 0.825 (m^3/kg) = 545.4545
Dry air mass2 (kg) = Room volume (m^3) ÷ SV2 0.868 (m^3/kg) = 518.4332
Energy1 (kJ) = Dry air mass1 (kg) × Enthalpy (kJ/kg) = 14,836.3624
Energy2 (kJ) = Dry air mass2 (kg) × Enthalpy (kJ/kg) = 33,957.3746
Excess = 19,121.0122 kJ

- Always 23.5 degrees between solstice and equinox
	- Toronto will never get sun at a degree of 90
	- For 32N, winters have a narrower arc than summers
- Sunpath horizontal projection, sky vault
- Equidistant sunpath diagram
	- polar coordinate system
- Same fenestration across the corners doesn't make sense
- Shading as a response to solar geometry
- Declination
- Latitude
- Altitude
- Azimuth: Angle between due south and the sun
	- Due south means facing directly south
- Vertical Shadow Angle: VSA, vertical angle between the ground plane an the shadow cast by the lading edge of an overhang
- Horizontal Shadow Angle: HSA, determined by the shadow cast by a vertical element in relation to the orientation of the vertical surface (such as a window)
	- **HSA = azimuth ± orientation**
- orientation = angle from due south of vertical surface
	- If wall faces due south: 
		- orientation = 0
		- HSA = azimuth
- **VSA = arctan(tan(altitude)/cos(HSA))** (Calculator in degrees)
	- tan(VSA) = tan(altitude)/cos(HSA)
- **Horizontal Projection = Window Height ÷ tan(VSA)**
	- **Lateral Projection = tan(HSA) × Horizontal Projection**
- **Vertical Projection = Window Depth-Width ÷ tan(HSA)**

**Cooling via Cross Ventilation (Natural Ventilation)** 
- q_ventilation (Btu/h) = V (cfm) × heat capacity of air (Btu·min/(ft3·°F·h)) × ∆T (°F) ^bd2f04
	- A unit of power
	- Requires openings on both sides and wind perpendicular to the opening surface
	- V: Volumetric flow rate (cfm cubic feet per minute)
		- V = Cv × A × v ^8218c4
			- Cv = is the coefficient for wind direction compared to the opening: 0.55 perpendicular, 0.3 angled 
			- A = area of the opening (ft^2) 
				- Bottleneck is the smaller of the two
			- v = velocity of the wind in feet per minute 
				- 1 mile per hour (mph) = 88 feet per minute (fpm) ^ff7bf9
	- heat capacity of air Btu·min/(ft3·°F·h) = 0.018 Btu/(ft3·°F)  × 60 min/h = **1.08 Btu·min/(ft3·°F·h)**
		- OR heat capacity of air (Btu/(ft3·°F)) = density (pounds per cubic ft) × specific heat of air (Btu/(lb·°F))
	- ∆T is temperature difference between inside and outside air
		- At least 3°F for cross ventilation to be feasible

**Degree Days** 
- Has units of (degrees · days)
- HDD ^2e7c60
	- HDD = BPT - Ave Temp
		- HDD for the day is ignored if average outside temperature is warmer than balance point temperature
- CDD
	- CDD = Ave Temp - BPT
		- CDD for the day is ignored if average outside temperature is cooler than balance point temperature
- [degreeedays](http://degreedays.net)


**Cost of Thermal Comfort (Heating and Cooling)**
- Heating
	- Annual Heat Needed (Btu)= UA_total (Btu/h\*^o𝐹) × HDD × 24 hours ^359eb9
	- Annual Fuel Needed, E (ft3) = Annual Heat (Btu) ÷ (AFUE × heat value of fuel (Btu/ft3)) ^591155
		- Specific to the fuel source and equipment
		- AFUE is the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency
			- Assume 95%
			- Natural gas furnaces have an AFUE range between 80% to 98.5%
		- Heat value for natural gas is **1050 Btu/ft3**
	- **Annual Cost of Heating** (\$) = E × Cost of Fuel ($/ft3) ^423ef7
		- Currently (October 2024) the effective gas supply rate is about 7.7043 cents per cubic meter for commercial customers of Enbridge in Toronto. 1 m3 = 35.315 ft3, thus 0.218 cents per ft3 or  $0.00218/ft3 or $2.18/1000 ft3
- Cooling
	- Summer BPT needed for Summer Cooling Cost
		- **Rough** estimate is adding 10F to the Winter BPT.  This assume higher indoor setpoint, no shading, and no open windows for cross ventilation.
			- Historically 50°F was used as the base temperature for calculating annual cooling.
			-  If we can provide shading to some of the south glass we can improve the Summer BPT.
			- assume 80% effective shading, thus allowing 20% of the solar gain.
		- T_balance = T_desired: 78°F  (25.6°C) - Q_i: Heat gain ÷ UA_total: Heat loss
	- **Annual Cost of Cooling** (\$) = Cooling Load (Btu/h) × CLH (h) × 1/SEER (W/Btu/h) × cost of electricity ($/Wh) ^8fe61e
		- Cooling Load (Btu/h) From W6
			- July Solar insolation for vertical surface, south facing glazing is 1,035 Btu/(day·ft2) in Toronto
				- q_insolation cube summer@80%shade = 3,996 ft2 × 0.20 × 1,035 Btu/(day·ft2) × (day/24 h) = 34,687 Btu/h
				- Only change solar insulation q_solar_summer_shaded, q_internal remains same
		- CLH: Cooling Load Hours (h) = CDD × 24 (h/day) ÷ (Design Temperature - Summer BPT) ^f100e8
		- SEER: Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio ((Btu/h)/W)
			- Btu/h heat rejected per Watt of electricity used
			- For example AHU: Air Handling Unit could be 14
		- Cost of Electricity for example use 15 cents per kWh,  $0.15/1000Wh

![[ARC2047H-Building_Science_Materials_and_Construction_3#^caf758|^caf758]]

q_ventilation (Btu/h) = V (cfm) × heat capacity of air (Btu·min/(ft3·°F·h)) × ∆T (°F)
23.4 tons × 12000 = 280,800 Btu/h
280,800 = V × 1.08 × 7.1
V = 36619 cfm

2. If the total summer cooling load for a building can be cooled using cross ventilation with a volumetric flow rate of 60,645 cubic feet per minute, determine the **area of openings needed** on the windward side of the building if the average wind speed is 13.2 mph and the wind approaches at a 45 degree angle to the opening. Assume that the building has an equal amount of openings on the windward and leeward sides of the building. Provide your answer in square feet as an integer.  Do not write units in your answer.
