For a well-sealed and highly insulated room with a wall air conditioner, how much **heat energy** would need to be removed from the room to get from a starting condition where the air is at 31 C and 56% RH to and a ending condition where the air is at 19 and 49% RH?  The room has a width of 10m, a length of 15m and is 3m high. Provide your answer in kJ as an integer.  Do not write the units in your answer.

h1=27.2kJ/kg
h2=65.5kJ/kg
V=450m^3
Dry air mass1 (kg) = Room volume (m^3) / SV1 0.825 (m^3/kg) = 545.4545
Dry air mass2 (kg) = Room volume (m^3) / SV2 0.868 (m^3/kg) = 518.4332
Energy1 (kJ) = Dry air mass1 (kg) * Enthalpy (kJ/kg) = 14,836.3624
Energy2 (kJ) = Dry air mass2 (kg) * Enthalpy (kJ/kg) = 33,957.3746
Excess = 19,121.0122 kJ

- Always 23.5 degrees between solstice and equinox
	- Toronto will never get sun at a degree of 90
	- For 32N, winters have a narrower arc than summers
- Sunpath horizontal projection, sky vault
- Equidistant sunpath diagram
	- polar coordinate system
- Same fenestration across the corners doesn't make sense
- Shading as a response to solar geometry
- Declination
- Latitude
- Altitude
- Azimuth: Angle between due south and the sun
	- Due south means facing directly south
- Vertical Shadow Angle: VSA, vertical angle between the ground plane an the shadow cast by the lading edge of an overhang
- Horizontal Shadow Angle: HSA, determined by the shadow cast by a vertical element in relation to the orientation of the vertical surface (such as a window)
	- **HSA = azimuth ± orientation**
- orientation = angle from due south of vertical surface
	- If wall faces due south: 
		- orientation = 0
		- HSA = azimuth
- **VSA = arctan(tan(altitude)/cos(HSA))** (Calculator in degrees)
	- tan(VSA) = tan(altitude)/cos(HSA)
- **Horizontal Projection = Window Height / tan(VSA)**
	- **Lateral Projection = tan(HSA) * Horizontal Projection**
- **Vertical Projection = Window Depth-Width / tan(HSA)**
### Q2

#### Module 04

T_balance point = T_indoor - Heat gain rate / Heat losses rate per degree T
T_balance point = T_inside - Q_inside Heat Gain / UA_total Heat Loss

Units of Power: Btu/h, W
Units of Energy: Btu, kWh
W = J / s
1 kWh = 3600000 J

q_total = q_skin + q_inf = UA_total * T_delta
T_delta = (T_inside - T_outside)
Q_i = q_solar + q_internal

q_solar (Btu/h) = Solar Insolation (BTU/(day-ft^2)) * Surface Area South (ft^2) * 1d/24h

q_internal

When Q_i = q_total
T_outside = T_inside - Q_i / UA_total

UA_total = UA_envelope + UA_infiltration

UA_envelope = U-value * Area (ft^2)
U (Btu/(h\*ft^2\*^oF)) (W/m^2 ^oK) = 1 / R 
U = k: Conductivity / Thickness
U-Value = 1 / R-Value
0 ^oC = 273.15 \^oK

UA_infiltration = ACH (h^-1) * Indoor Air Volume (ft^3) * Heat Capacity of Air (Btu / (ft^3 \* ^oF)) (J/(m^3 \* ^oK))
ACH: Air Changes per Hour = 0.44 (h^-1)
Heat Capacity of Air (Btu / (ft^3 * ^oF)) = Density of Air * Specific Heat of Air = 0.075 lb/ft^3 * 0.24 Btu/(lb * ^oF) = 0.018 Btu/(ft^3·°F)

### Q3

#### Module 07

**Cooling via Cross Ventilation (Natural Ventilation)** 
- q_ventilation = V × (heat capacity of air) × ∆T
	- A unit of power
	- Requires openings on both sides and wind perpendicular to the opening surface
	- V: Volumetric flow rate (cfm cubic feet per minute)
		- V = Cv × A × v
			- Cv = is the coefficient for wind direction compared to the opening: 0.55 perpendicular, 0.3 angled 
			- A = area of the opening (ft^2) 
				- Bottleneck is the smaller of the two
			- v = velocity of the wind in feet per minute 
				- 1 mile per hour (mph) = 88 feet per minute (fpm)
	- heat capacity of air Btu·min/(ft3·°F·h) = 0.018 Btu/(ft3·°F)  × 60 min/h = 1.08 Btu·min/(ft3·°F·h)
		- OR heat capacity of air (Btu/(ft3·°F)) = density (pounds per cubic ft) * specific heat of air (Btu/(lb·°F))
	- ∆T is temperature difference between inside and outside air
		- At least 3°F for cross ventilation to be feasible

**Degree Days** 
- Has units of (degrees · days)
- HDD
	- HDD = BPT - Ave Temp
		- HDD for the day is ignored if outside temperature is warmer than balance point temperature
- CDD
	- CDD = Ave Temp - BPT
		- CDD for the day is ignored if outside temperature is warmer than balance point temperature
- [degreeedays](http://degreedays.net)


**Cost of Thermal Comfort (Heating and Cooling)**
- Heating
	- Annual Heat Needed = UA_total (Btu/h\*^o𝐹) × HDD × 24 hours
	- Annual Fuel Needed, E = Annual Heat (Btu) / (AFUE × heat value of fuel (Btu/ft^3))
		- Specific to the fuel source and equipment
		- AFUE is the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency
			- Assume 95%
		- Natural gas furnaces have an AFUE range between 80% to 98.5%
		- Heat value for natural gas is **1050 Btu/ft3**
	- Cost of Heating = E × Cost of Fuel
		- Currently (October 2024) the effective gas supply rate is about 7.7043 cents per cubic meter for commercial customers of Enbridge in Toronto. 1 m3 = 35.315 ft3, thus 0.218 cents per ft3 or  $0.00218/ft3 or $2.18/1000 ft3
- Cooling
	- Summer BPT needed for Summer Cooling Cost
		- **Rough** estimate is adding 10F to the Winter BPT.  This assume higher indoor setpoint, no shading, and no open windows for cross ventilation.
			- Historically 50°F was used as the base temperature for calculating annual cooling.
			-  If we can provide shading to some of the south glass we can improve the Summer BPT.
			- assume 80% effective shading, thus allowing 20% of the solar gain.
		- T_balance = T_desired: 78°F  (25.6°C) - Q_i: Heat gain / UA_total: Heat loss
	- **Annual Cooling Cost = Cooling Load (Btu/h) × CLH (h) × 1/SEER (W/Btu/h) × cost of electricity ($/Wh)**
		- Cooling Load (Btu/h) From W6
			- July Solar insolation for vertical surface, south facing glazing is 1,035 Btu/(day·ft2) in Toronto
				- q_insolation cube summer@80%shade = 3,996 ft2 × 0.20 × 1,035 Btu/(day·ft2) × (day/24 h) = 34,687 Btu/h
				- Only change solar insulation q_solar_summer_shaded, q_internal remains same
		- CLH: Cooling Load Hours (h) = CDD * 24 (h/day) / (Design Temperature - Summer BPT)
		- SEER: Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (W/Btu/h)
			- Btu/h heat rejected per Watt of electricity used
			- For example AHU: Air Handling Unit could be 14
		- Cost of Electricity for example use 15 cents per kWh,  $0.15/1000Wh
