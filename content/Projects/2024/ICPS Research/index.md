## Project Scope Summary:

The BIA Office has partnered with OCAD to sponsor a research project, entitled: _Planning for Post Covid-19 Futures of Public Space: Grounding Decision-Making in Community Perceptions and Insights._ The research project is funded by SSHRC (the Government of Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council) and will eventually result in the development of a community-informed integrated urban design and communication strategy and set of implementable design guidelines for identified BIA pilot sites as part of future phases.

## Task Details
### June 18 Tasks 

**ENVR Tasks for Tuesday, June 18th:**

1. Define the site boundaries as per the Masterplans and with respect to the table size (30 inches x 60 inches (2.5ft x 5 ft)
2. Export site data from City of Toronto GIS
3. Prepare base file of study area in preferred software (Rhino?)
4. Prepare thoughts on scale and material for discussion on June 18th

**GRPH Tasks for Tuesday, June 18th:**

1. Develop concepts for 2D graphics deliverables
2. Goal: Each BIA (Weston Village and Church Wellesley) will need a dynamic visual(s) with details that are unique to each community. The visual(s) will need to be scalable so that they can be reproduced at high quality on something as small as an iPad screen or as large as a table wrap. I recommend vector work (.ai) but if your idea requires photos you will need to ensure you take them at a size that will be appropriate for the scale of the project needs. Visuals must be original work and photos should not include people unless you have their express permission to use it. I can provide a model release form and let’s discuss the benefits and challenges of showcasing people in advance.
3. If there is time share any local sources for production; I have provided some examples at the bottom of the TASK LIST FOR RAs.docx linked above. We can use supplier above as they are typically good with deadlines, but of course open to other options at this phase.
4. Phase one for our check in at 7:30 am (EDT), Tuesday June 18: B prepared to share visualized concepts that we can discuss and then refine to present to the rest of the team on  Wednesday June 19 at 7:30 am (EDT).
