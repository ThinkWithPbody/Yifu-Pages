### File Preparation

![[./Attachments/Yifu Design Lab/2024-04-10T21_01_21-05_00_TWP-X570-WIN10(Rhino).gif|2024-04-10T21_01_21-05_00_TWP-X570-WIN10(Rhino)]]

#### Orientate

Choose printing **orientation** for maximum smoothness. 
- Printing a thin, organic piece vertically provides smoother detail and needs less support than laying it flat on the bed.

#### Divide

Divide large models exceeding the **build volume** with a **planar** cutter to provide **flat surfaces** that will adhere to the print bed nicely.
- Each model need to be a closed solid with no non-manifold geometry. They should be **watertight**.
- For pieces that are thin and tall, height is recommended to not exceed 100 mm.
- Keep in mind that any **overhang** exceeding 25 degrees will need substantial support structure which could be reduced or eliminated if they were divided and orientated differently.
- **WireCut** is a great command for this purpose. If WireCut didn't work on your model, chances are it isn't watertight and it won't print properly either.

#### Export

Files should be exported as **STL in millimetres**.
- Rhino files or incorrectly scaled STL will not be accepted.
- **Each separated body should be one file** regardless of which plate they may be on, to maximize nesting potential.
	- When relative positioning is important, add a small bridge with a cross section of 0.5-1mm² (depending on strength requirement) directly on the print bed and boolean union all connected bodies.
- For multiple objects, use the Rhino command **RunPythonScript** with the [[Projects/2024/Yifu's 3D Printing Service/Attachments/Yifu Design Lab/BatchExportSTLByObj.py|Batch Export Python Script]] to export all selected files at once.
- Deliver more than one .stl files as a **ZIP**.

### FAQ

###### *Why is there a setup fee?*

This setup fee allows me to take more care optimizing your print file and compensates me for my continued presence. Optimizations can massively reduce your print time and filament, lowering total cost, but each job is different and it takes time. I try my best to provide affordable and environmentally responsible printing service, which is why I offer my time and expertise at a modest fee. You'll always have the option to slice it by yourself and I am pleased to waive the setup fee for such cases, but current success rate for this option is only 0%.
